## Problem Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Example 1

```text
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

## Constraints

	- `n == height.length`

	- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10⁴

	- 0 <= height[i] <= 10⁵
